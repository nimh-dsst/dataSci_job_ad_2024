# Hiring: Data Scientist

The Data Science and Sharing Team [(DSST)](http://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst) within the National Institute of Mental Health's [(NIMH)](http://www.nimh.nih.gov) Intramural Research Program [(IRP)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh) in Bethesda, MD has an open on-site or hybrid position for an early to mid-career data scientist.

## About the NIH, NIMH, & IRP

With a current budget of over $2.5B per year, the [NIMH](http://www.nimh.nih.gov) is among the largest divisions of the [NIH](http://www.nih.gov) and is the largest funder of research on mental disorders in the world. The NIMH mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.  The IRP is the [largest biomedical research institution on earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIH_Intramural_Research_Program#:~:text=the%20NIH%20Intramural%20Research%20Program%20is%20the%20largest%20biomedical%20research%20institution%20on%20earth) where the unique funding environment allows scientists to conduct both long-term and high-impact science that would difficult to impossible in a grant-dependent institution.

## About the Team

The DSST is responsible for leading and supporting data-intensive scientific projects within the NIMH Intramural Research Program [(IRP)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/index.shtml). We work closely with the [Machine Learning Team](http://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt) as well as other IRP investigators (e.g. [Armin Raznahan](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/hgb/sdn), [Peter Bandettini](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/lbc/sfim), [Robert Innis](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/mib/spns)). Special emphasis is placed on reproducible analyses of high dimensional genetic, genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral datasets.

We also work to implement the [policy guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/) from the White House Office of Science Policy ([OSTP)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/) to ensure free, immediate, and equitable public access to federally funded research, foster greater collaboration and innovation, and strengthen public trust.

Everything we create is open source and freely distributed. A full listing of research objects from out team as of December 2023 is available in our [Board of Scientific Counsellors Report]().

## About the Position

### Responsibilities

- Building tools and pipelines for reproducible data analysis using Python
- Implementing reproducible pipelines using both High Performance Computing and Elastic Cloud Computing  
- Writing clear documentation and scholarly publications
- Teaching and consulting on data science and best practices for reproducibility (e.g. [Software and Data Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [BrainHack Global](https://brainhack.org/global2023/))
- Creating, expanding, and supporting [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) data standards in biomedical science (*e.g.* [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/), [NWB](https://www.nwb.org/) [OME](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/), [GO](https://geneontology.org/))

This position has minimal supervisory responsibilities, however motivated and productive individuals will have the opportunity to quickly assume more a senior role involving supervision and oversight of additional projects in parallel.

### Necessary Qualifications

- A recent graduate degree (PhD preferred) in a [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) field or equivalent knowledge and experience
- Strong coding skills in Python
- Experience with version control and continuous integration with git and github
- Experience with more than one type of biomedical data (e.g. neuroimaging, genomics, next generation sequencing (NGS), transcriptomics, electrophysiology, microscopy)

### Desirable but not Required Qualifications

- Experience working with biomedical data repositories and biobanks (*e.g.* [The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Project (ABCD)](https://nda.nih.gov/abcd/),  [OpenNeuro](http://openneuro.org), [UK Biobank](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), [GTEX](https://gtexportal.org/home/)) 
- Experience with distributed, high-performance computing tools such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com)/[Apptainer (formerly Singularity)](https://apptainer.org/documentation/) and batch processing systems such as [SLURM](http://slurm.schedmd.com/)
