# Hiring: Data Scientist
The Data Science and Sharing Team [(DSST)](http://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst) within the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Intramural Reseach Program (IRP) in Bethesda, MD has an open on-site or hybrid position for an early to mid-career data scientist.

## About the NIMH
With a current budget of over $2B per year, the [NIMH](http://www.nimh.nih.gov) is among the largest divisions of the [NIH](http://www.nih.gov) and is the largest funder of research on mental disorders in the world. The NIMH mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.  The scientist in the Intramural Research Program pursues that mission in a secure funding environment without the need to obtain grants.

## About the Team
The DSST is responsible for leading and supporting data-intensive scientific projects within the NIMH Intramural Research Program [(IRP)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/index.shtml). We work closely with the [Machine Learning Team](http://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt) as well as other IRP investigators (e.g. [Armin Raznahan](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/hgb/sdn), [Peter Bandettini](),Robert Innis]()). Special emphasis is placed on reproducible analyses of high dimensional genetic, genomic, neuroimaging and behavioral datasets.

Everything we create is open source and freely distributed. We also work to implement the [policy guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/) from the White House Office of Science Policy ([OSTP)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/) to ensure free, immediate, and equitable public access to federally funded research, foster greater collaboration and innovation, and strengthen public trust.

## About the Position

### Responsibilities

- Building tools and pipelines for reproducible data analysis using Python
- Implementing reproducible pipelines using both High Performance Computing and Elastic Cloud Computing  
- Writing clear documentation and scholarly publications
- Teaching and consulting on data science and best practices for reproducibility (e.g. [Software and Data Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [BrainHack Global](https://brainhack.org/global2023/)
- Creating and expanding [(FAIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) data standards in biomedical science (e.g BIDS, NWB, new NGS one....)

This position has minimal supervisory responsibilities, however motivated and productive individuals will have the opportunity to quickly assume more a senior role involving more supervision and oversight of additional projects in parallel.


### Nescessary Qualifications 

- A recent graduate degree (PhD preferred) in a [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) field or equivalent knowledge and experience
- Strong coding skill in Python
- Experience with version control and continuous integration with git and github.
- Expereince with more than one type of biomedical data (e.g. neuroimaging, genomics, next generation sequencing (NGS), transcriptomics, electrophysiology, microscopy) 


### Desirable but not required Qualifications
- Experience working with biomedical data repositories and biobanks (*e.g.* [The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Project (ABCD)](https://nda.nih.gov/abcd/),  [OpenNeuro](http://openneuro.org), [UK Biobank](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), [The NIMH Data Archive](http://nda.nih.gov)). 
- Experience with distributed, high-performance computing tools such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com)/[Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov) and batch processing systems such as [SLURM](http://slurm.schedmd.com/)- 


### Building tools and data pipelines

You will work with a team of researchers and developers to build and deploy data processing pipelines in collaboration with NIH investigators. You will have the resources of theat your disposal, as well as cloud compute infrastructure through the [STRIDES Initiative](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides). 


### Implementing, Advancing, and Creating Data Standards

Data standards are critical for making open data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable [(FAIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data). You will be implementing and contributing to projects throughout the world that are building standards and tools for open and reproducible neuroscience (*e.g.* [OpenMicroscopy](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/), [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/), and [NWB](https://www.nwb.org/)).

## Qualifications

### Education

You should have . It is fine if you are recently graduated or early in your career. Ideally, you should be comfortable building processing pipelines for complex biomedical data. For this position, we are particularly interested in candidates who have experience beyond classic  Candidates with other backgrounds in biomedical science are also welcome to apply.

### Technical Experience

You should have experience coding in modern languages currently used in data-intensive, scientific computing (e.g., Python or R) and version control systems like git.   is a plus, as is experience with front-end development and visualization with JavaScript or other data visualization tools. Please provide some concrete examples of your code, ideally checked in to an online repository like Github or BitBucket, and any associated publications or pre-prints.


### Drive and Motivation

We are seeking someone who is interested in and motivated by our mission to increase transparency and data availability in biomedical science. We decide on projects and priorities together as a team and are looking for people to participate fully in that process.

Our offices are on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland and preference will be given to candidates who are able to work onsite, though hybrid arrangements are possible.
