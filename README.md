# Hiring: Data Scientist
The Data Science and Sharing Team [(DSST)](http://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst) at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, MD has an open position for a data scientist. With a current budget of over $2B per year, the [NIMH](http://www.nimh.nih.gov) is among the largest divisions of the [NIH](http://www.nih.gov) and is the largest funder of research on mental disorders in the world. The NIMH mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. 

The DSST is responsible for leading and supporting data-intensive scientific projects within the NIMH Intramural Research Program [(IRP)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/index.shtml). We work closely with the [Machine Learning Team](http://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt) who develop and apply new analyses to better understand complex brain function and disorders. As well as other IRP research groups, such as Section of Neurodevelopmental Genomics led by Armin Raznahan. 

Recent notable projects of ours and/or our collaborators include:
- [Evolutionary divergence between homologous X-Y chromosome genes shapes sex-biased biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.27.586985v1.abstract)
- [X-chromosome influences on neuroanatomical variation in humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00890-w)
- [The positive–negative mode link between brain connectivity, demographics and behaviour: a pre-registered replication of Smith et al. (2015)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201090)
- [Improving the Interpretability of fMRI Decoding Using Deep Neural Networks and Adversarial Robustness](https://apertureneuro.org/article/85074)
- [Demonstrating quality control (QC) procedures in fMRI](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1205928/full)

These projects are examples of the type of work you will be doing. Particularly, we are looking to fill this position with someone who can broaden our skill set to include new methods (e.g., next generation sequencing) and/or modalities (e.g., microscopy). 

We also work to implement the [policy guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/) from the White House Office of Science Policy ([OSTP)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/) to ensure free, immediate, and equitable public access to federally funded research, foster greater collaboration and innovation, and strengthen public trust.

## Responsibilities

### Building tools and data pipelines

You will work with a team of researchers and developers to build and deploy data processing pipelines in collaboration with NIH investigators. You will have the resources of the [NIH High Performance Compute (HPC) Cluster](https://hpc.nih.gov/) at your disposal, as well as cloud compute infrastructure through the [STRIDES Initiative](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides). Everything we create is open source and freely distributed. 

### Teaching, Guiding, & Mentoring on Data Science Best Practices

You will work to cultivate data science skills within the NIH by teaching courses to scientists on best data practices (e.g. [Software and Data Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [BrainHack Global](https://brainhack.org/global2023/, ) as well as interfacing with specific data repositories and biobanks (*e.g.* [The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Project (ABCD)](https://nda.nih.gov/abcd/),  [OpenNeuro](http://openneuro.org), [UK Biobank](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), [The NIMH Data Archive](http://nda.nih.gov)). 

### Implementing, Advancing, and Creating Data Standards

Data standards are critical for making open data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable [(FAIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data). You will be implementing and contributing to projects throughout the world that are building standards and tools for open and reproducible neuroscience (*e.g.* [OpenMicroscopy](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/), [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/), and [(NWB)](https://www.nwb.org/).

## Qualifications

### Education

You should have a recent graduate degree (PhD preferred) in a [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) field. It is fine if you are recently graduated or early in your career. Ideally, you should be comfortable building processing pipelines for complex biomedical data. For this position, we are particularly interested in candidates who have experience beyond classic human neuroimaging modalities and methods, such as genomics, next generation sequencing, transcriptomics, and/or microscopy (confocal and/or light sheet). Candidates with other backgrounds in biomedical science are also welcome to apply.

### Technical Experience

You should have experience coding in modern languages currently used in data-intensive, scientific computing (e.g., Python or R) and version control systems like git.  Experience with distributed, high-performance computing tools such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com)/[Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov) and batch processing systems such as [SLURM](http://slurm.schedmd.com/) is a plus, as is experience with front-end development and visualization with JavaScript or other data visualization tools. Please provide some concrete examples of your code, ideally checked in to an online repository like Github or BitBucket, and any associated publications or pre-prints.


### Drive and Motivation

We are seeking someone who is interested in and motivated by our mission to increase transparency and data availability in biomedical science. We decide on projects and priorities together as a team and are looking for people to participate fully in that process.

Our offices are on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland and preference will be given to candidates who are able to work onsite, though hybrid arrangements are possible.
